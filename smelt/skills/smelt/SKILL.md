description: Configure and use Smelt to check Python architecture, package APIs, source conventions and test quality. Use for smelt.yml policies, SMT findings, changed or staged checks, debt baselines and Smelt hook/CI integration.

# Use Smelt

Smelt is a static Python guardrail tool. Follow the project's existing policy and
use findings as evidence for a repair; advisory findings still require judgment.
This official skill and its offline manual ship with `smelt-cli`. `VERSION` in an
installed skill records the CLI version that installed it.

## Work in the actual project

1. Read project instructions, dependency pins and `smelt.yml` (or `smelt.yaml`).
   Use the project's command runner: examples below use `smelt`; a project-local
   dependency commonly uses `uv run smelt`. Check `smelt --version` against
   `VERSION`. After upgrading Smelt, refresh with `smelt skill install --force`
   using the same `--destination` if installed outside the default directory.
2. Before creating or moving code, run `smelt context <feature-or-module-or-path>`.
   For inherited policy, inspect `smelt config show --sources --format json`.
   A planned path is valid for `context`; explicit `check` paths must already exist.
3. After editing, run `smelt check --changed --fail-on warning --format json`.
   Read the evidence, use `smelt explain <code-or-name>` and fix the underlying
   behavior or dependency. Run relevant tests and the project's other checks too.
4. For branch review use `--changed --base origin/main` (or the actual base).
   For the commit use `smelt check --staged --fail-on warning`; this reads the Git
   index, including partially staged files and policy, rather than the working tree.
   Run a full `smelt check --fail-on warning` after policy changes and for CI.

## Policy and repair rules

- Most checks are opt-in. Fixed patterns use `rules: {rule-name: severity}`;
  architecture/package/test policies activate their associated rules. Use
  `smelt rules --format json` for the installed catalog and activation metadata.
  Do not assume a clean run means every rule or every source file was checked.
- `--select` replaces normal selection; names, SMT prefixes and `ALL` are accepted.
  Explicit `off`, closest-package overrides and CLI ignores retain their semantics.
  Strict coverage cannot be bypassed with selection or lower severities. Choose
  policy for the project's intended boundaries; do not enable ALL as a default.
- Normal checks are read-only. `--fix` writes permitted source-ordering repairs;
  behavior-changing SMT321 repairs also need `--unsafe-fixes` and review of falsy
  values. `--unsafe-fixes` alone writes nothing. `--staged` rejects `--fix`.
- Do not disable checks, broaden exclusions or record debt merely to pass a check.
  When intentionally adopting a baseline, `smelt debt` records current findings
  and changes configuration. `smelt debt --prune` removes resolved debt without
  accepting new findings; `smelt debt --show` inspects stored debt read-only.
- For an intentional local exception, use a specific code and reason, for example
  `# smelt: ignore[SMT101] -- migration tracked in #123`. Statement comments do not
  suppress a whole function body. Keep exceptions narrow and address unused ones.
- Exit codes are `0` for passing, `1` for findings at the failure threshold, `2`
  for usage/configuration/analysis errors. Hints do not fail a check. JSON check
  reports use schema 2; inspect scope, comparison and coverage before interpreting
  `passed`. Changed/staged checks report new findings under current/index policy,
  including effects elsewhere; they do not inventory all existing violations.
- Smelt never replaces tests, Ruff or a type checker. It analyzes source statically;
  use a Python interpreter that can parse the project. Read each rule's inference
  limits before changing a public API or deciding a finding is a false positive.

For first-time installation use `uv tool install smelt-cli`, then
`smelt skill install` in the target project. Only run `smelt init` (or
`smelt init --maintainability`) when a new policy is needed; review the inferred
configuration. `init --force` overwrites policy. An installed skill is replaced
only on an explicit `skill install --force`, including local edits and obsolete
references. Put project-specific instructions outside the installed skill.
